            I love coding, working with people and learning new technology.
          </p>

          <p class="measure-wide lh-copy">
            I've worked in the tech industry since 2006
          </p>

          <p class="measure-wide lh-copy">
            My first tech job was at <a target="_blank" href="https://kamahi.com">Kamahi Electronics</a> where I worked for 7 years. I was involved with many commercially successful product developments. I built, tested and fixed high end scientific equipment and designed multi-layer PCBs for <a target="_blank" href="4GAS.pdf">complex</a> <a target="_blank" href="WE32.pdf">mixed</a> <a target="_blank" href="sModule.pdf">signal</a> <a target="_blank" href="HIMUX_XR.pdf">equipment</a>. I used intuition, tenacity and knowledge from mulitple domains to diagnose and fix difficult technical issues. I learned embedded C programming for microcontrollers and my code is running in the wild on <a target="_blank" href="https://antecscientific.com/detectors-and-analyzers/decade-detectors/decade-elite">scientific</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.vaakacadence.com/">sporting</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.huntersafetylab.com/iris/">safety</a> products.
          </p>

          <p class="measure-wide lh-copy">
            While working at Kamahi Electronics I ran a small electronics production business with my brother. We contracted to Kamahi Electronics and shipped several hundred research quality scientific instruments to The Netherlands over two years.
          </p>

          <p class="measure-wide lh-copy">
            After leaving Kamahi and moving to Wellington I worked as a freelance electronics and embedded developer, often contracting back to Kamahi or <a href="http://www.huntersafetylab.com/">Hunter Safety Lab</a> among others.
          </p>

        <div class="fl w100 w-50-ns pa2">

          <p class="measure-wide lh-copy">
            I worked as a facilitating teacher for <a target="_blank" href="https://www.devacademy.co.nz/">Enspiral Dev Academy</a>. In my time there I taught or helped teach more than 100 aspiring developers to code. The core of the work involved modelling and solving live coding problems in a classroom environment, but I also facilitated students through difficult conversations, group conflict and emotional breakdowns. My job required that I role modeled vulnerability and empathetic listening which are essential for effective student engagement. I loved working with teams of people, every team was different and had its own unique character.
          </p>

          <p class="measure-wide lh-copy">
            I'm a founding member of the <a class="link underline-hover" target="_blank" href="http://protozoa.nz">Protozoa</a> cooperative.
          </p>

          <p class="measure-wide lh-copy">
            I was the main developer for ~1 year working on the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/sunrise-choir">Sunrise Choir</a> project, an ongoing open-source project to re-write <a target="_blank" href="http://scuttlebutt.nz">scuttlebutt</a> in rust.
          </p>

          <p>
            My wife Katie and I moved from Wellington to Amsterdam where I worked for <a target="_blank" href="https://www.funda.nl/">funda.nl</a> as .NET backend developer. We've since moved back to Wellington because of covid.

He can communicate his ideas clearly and does so while paying close attention to others. He is a good listener and very empathetic. Piet has the incredible ability to be responsive to the moods and emotions of others with empathy and understanding while still maintaining a balanced and calm demeanour. I have been witness to him dealing with conflict in a very honest and communicative way, he is the first to admit that he has made a mistake and is faultless in his approach to rectifying it. I would recommend Piet as a human and as a developer."

He took the time to share his skills and expertise in a way that was relatable and easy to understand. Piet was friendly, approachable and always happy to help with anything I found challenging. "

              "I was a student at Enspiral Dev Academy last year where Piet was the teacher and I can honestly say I have never met someone so invested on teaching as he is. I will always have the most convoluted questions to ask in class and he will always find time to answer them, to go above and beyond for his students. His devotion to our learning was not only seen on the teaching of Javascript which he did during long day after day, but he also shared with us the classes of engineer's empathy. These classes were about being a better person and getting closer to other people. It was not mandatory for him to be there, to expose himself like that, but he still did it because he thought it was important. I am sure I have learned Javascript the best possible way, as he is quite adamant in all the best practises, but most importantly I learned that you can be an amazing person and work fantastically with others. Thanks to him I can now believe I am a programmer."
