            I love coding, working with people and learning new technology.
          </p> 

          <p class="measure-wide">
            I've worked in the tech industry since 2006
          </p> 

          <p class="measure-wide">
            My first tech job was at <a target="_blank" href="https://kamahi.com">Kamahi Electronics</a> where I worked for 7 years. I was involved with many commercially successful product developments. I built, tested and fixed high end scientific equipment and designed multi-layer PCBs for <a target="_blank" href="4GAS.pdf">complex</a> <a target="_blank" href="WE32.pdf">mixed</a> <a target="_blank" href="sModule.pdf">signal</a> <a target="_blank" href="HIMUX_XR.pdf">equipment</a>. I used intuition, tenacity and knowledge from mulitple domains to diagnose and fix difficult technical issues. I learned embedded C programming for microcontrollers and my code is running in the wild on <a target="_blank" href="https://antecscientific.com/detectors-and-analyzers/decade-detectors/decade-elite">scientific</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.vaakacadence.com/">sporting</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.huntersafetylab.com/iris/">safety</a> products.
          </p> 

          <p class="measure-wide">
            While working at Kamahi Electronics I ran a small electronics production business with my brother. We contracted to Kamahi Electronics and shipped several hundred research quality scientific instruments to The Netherlands over two years. 
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="fl w100 w-50-ns pa2">
          <p class="measure-wide">
            After leaving Kamahi and moving to Wellington I worked as a freelance electronics and embedded developer, often contracting back to Kamahi or <a href="http://www.huntersafetylab.com/">Hunter Safety Lab</a> among others.
          </p>

          <p class="measure-wide">
            Most recently I worked as a facilitating teacher for <a target="_blank" href="https://www.devacademy.co.nz/">Enspiral Dev Academy</a>. In my time there I taught or helped teach more than 100 aspiring developers to code. The core of the work involved modelling and solving live coding problems in a classroom environment, but I also facilitated students through difficult conversations, group conflict and emotional breakdowns. My job required that I role modeled vulnerability and empathetic listening which are essential for effective student engagement. I loved working with teams of people, every team was different and had its own unique character.

              "I have worked with Piet in many different contexts over the last two years. It has always been a pleasure working with him. Piet has high integrity and is very kind and caring. He can communicate his ideas clearly and does so while paying close attention to others. He is a good listener and very empathetic. Piet has the incredible ability to be responsive to the moods and emotions of others with empathy and understanding while still maintaining a balanced and calm demeanour. I have been witness to him dealing with conflict in a very honest and communicative way, he is the first to admit that he has made a mistake and is faultless in his approach to rectifying it. I would recommend Piet as a human and as a developer."

I first met him as a student at Dev Academy and was so impressed with his ability and character that I hired him as a teacher the first chance I got. I'm thrilled to see him launching his own company and have no doubt he will be successful in the venture, you will be fortunate if you get the chance to hire him on to your project."

Piet would work hard to prepare his lectures and would make sure he led by example. As a school we request a lot of feedback from students. In fact as a school we welcome feedback from all of our stakeholders. Piet was someone who welcomed this and acted on it to better the experience. He was always learning and growing."

I will always have the most convoluted questions to ask in class and he will always find time to answer them, to go above and beyond for his students. His devotion to our learning was not only seen on the teaching of Javascript which he did during long day after day, but he also shared with us the classes of engineer's empathy. These classes were about being a better person and getting closer to other people. It was not mandatory for him to be there, to expose himself like that, but he still did it because he thought it was important. I am sure I have learned Javascript the best possible way, as he is quite adamant in all the best practises, but most importantly I learned that you can be an amazing person and work fantastically with others. Thanks to him I can now believe I am a programmer."
